## My Google.com homepage redesign

From this simple project I've learned to deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it, practicing my skills in HTML, CSS, DevTools and Git.
This is an assignment from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).
